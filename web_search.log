                            Summary: Article about Wall Street

The US S&P 500 zoomed past 6,000 points on Friday to a new record while Treasury yields retreated, as investors again cheered Donald Trump's decisive victory, although disappointment about China's latest fiscal support dampened the mood elsewhere.

A day after the Federal Reserve delivered a quarter-point rate cut, as anticipated, the focus returned to the fallout of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election and headlines out of Beijing.

The offshore yuan weakened, while U.S.-listed shares of Chinese firms and China exposed-sectors in Europe sank as investors took in news that China's stimulus did not directly inject money into the struggling economy.

But investors on Wall Street shrugged off frustration about the lack of a Chinese fiscal bazooka and bought U.S. stocks.

The S&P 500 index climbed to an intra-day high of 6,012.45 points before pulling back to finish up 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite ended flat.

The S&P 500 and the Dow had their best week in a year, while the Nasdaq had its best week in two months.

Shares of electric car maker Tesla, whose chief executive, Elon Musk, became one of Trump's biggest supporters in the last leg of his reelection campaign, shot up 8.2%, catapulting its market capitalization to $1 trillion for the first time since 2022.

Nicholas Colas, a co-founder of DataTrek Research LLC, said there are several reasons for buying U.S. stocks: "The Fed is cutting rates, and the U.S. economy is still strong."

In addition, the Republican party won not only the White House this week, but also control of the Senate, and may win control of the House of Representatives - a similar scenario, Colas said, to the November 2016 election outcome that preceded the S&P 500's 22% gain in 2017. Investors are betting that a Trump administration will bring lighter regulation and tax cuts that could boost the U.S. economy.

Outside the United States the mood was more subdued. The pan-European STOXX 600 lost 0.7%, while a MSCI index for world stocks was flat after hitting a record high on Friday. Still, the index for world stocks had its best week in three months.

"What you are going to get because of the clean sweep is a mandate to improve the U.S. economy. So, taxes will come down, bureaucracy will ease and regulation will become lighter," said Guy Miller, chief markets strategist at Zurich Insurance Group.

"Between now and year-end, there is a tailwind for U.S. stocks. The U.S. market has potential," he said.

Germany's DAX stock index fell 0.8% a day after posting its best daily performance of 2024 so far, helped by expectations that Germany could scrap its debt brake.

China unveiled a 10 trillion yuan ($1.40 trillion) debt package to ease local government financing strains and stabilize flagging economic growth.

Finance Minister Lan Fo'an said more stimulus was coming, with some analysts saying Beijing may not want to fire all its financial weapons before Trump takes over officially in January.

Mainland blue chips fell 1%, a day after rising 3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng also slid in a sign of some caution ahead of the announcement.

The offshore Chinese yuan fell 0.7% to 7.2011 per dollar . China-exposed European luxury and mining stocks each fell over 3%.

The dot plot shows the policy rates of the G10 central banks on March 1, 2024 and Nov. 7, 2024. The dot for Nov. 7 for countries which have started cutting rates is in orange, which are steady is in yellow and for those which are hiking are in purple.

FED CUTS

U.S. Treasury yields fell after Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday signaled continued, patient policy easing.

The Fed's rate cut followed a quarter-point cut from the Bank of England and a large half-point cut by Sweden, also on Thursday.

Ten-year Treasury yields fell 8.3 basis points to 4.343% , reversing sharp rises following the U.S. election result.

Powell said Tuesday's election result would have no "near-term" impact on U.S. monetary policy.

"The Fed pointed to a more uncertain economic outlook and inflation remaining elevated," said Mahmood Pradhan, head of global macroeconomics at the Amundi Investment Institute.

"Together with a likely change in policy direction under the new administration, we expect a more uncertain and measured pace of easing next year."

The dollar index , which measures the currency against six major peers, rose to 104.91, following a 0.7% drop on Thursday, its biggest since Aug. 23. On Wednesday, it soared 1.53%, the most in over two years, a sign of increased volatility as investors assess the new Trump administration's policies.

The euro and sterling both fell against the dollar , , while the dollar slipped 0.3% to 152.46 yen .

Bitcoin was up 0.8% after hitting a record high, following a nearly 10% surge this week. Trump has vowed to make the United States "the crypto capital of the planet."

After a roller-coaster week, gold fell 0.9% to $2,683.87. It slumped more than 3% on Wednesday, but bounced 1.8% overnight. Last week it surged to an all-time high of $2,790.15.

Brent crude oil futures pared losses during London trade and were last down 2.1% at $74.01, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 2.6% to $70.45....

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite ended flat.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Dow had their best week in a year, while the Nasdaq had its best week in two months.\n\nShares of electric car maker Tesla, whose chief executive, Elon Musk, became one of Trump's biggest supporters in the last leg of his reelection campaign, shot up 8.2%, catapulting its market capitalization to $1 trillion for the first time since 2022.\n\nNicholas Colas, a co-founder of DataTrek Research LLC, said there are several reasons for buying U.S. stocks: \"The Fed is cutting rates, and the U.S. economy is still strong.\"\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nIn addition, the Republican party won not only the White House this week, but also control of the Senate, and may win control of the House of Representatives - a similar scenario, Colas said, to the November 2016 election outcome that preceded the S&P 500's 22% gain in 2017. Investors are betting that a Trump administration will bring lighter regulation and tax cuts that could boost the U.S. economy.\n\nOutside the United States the mood was more subdued.

    Summary: 
    Wall Street

Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notching their biggest one-day losses in two weeks, on concerns about slower interest-rate cuts and as investors reacted to cabinet picks by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday cited ongoing economic growth, a solid job market, and inflation above the U.S. central bank's 2% target as reasons it can afford to be careful with the pace and scope of future rate cuts.

Traders increased bets the Fed will not change rates at its December meeting, pricing in a roughly 42% chance, versus roughly 14% a month ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool. They also dialed back expectations for easing in 2025.

This view was reinforced by Friday's economic data showing U.S. retail sales rose slightly more than expected in October. Import prices also rebounded and data released on Wednesday and Thursday showed sticky inflation.

A column chart titled "Monthly change in US retail sales" that tracks the metric over the last year. Retail sales rose 0.4% in October.

"In the last 48 hours we've had some pretty big changes, not just from the election but from economic data that was better than expected and Powell speaking about not having to be as aggressive on interest rate cuts," said Adam Rich, deputy chief investment officer for Vaughan Nelson in Houston.

"Market expectations for interest rate cuts have come down materially and also the market is readjusting after a pretty bullish reaction to the U.S. election."

Friday's sell-off ended a week in which market focus shifted from the U.S. election win by Trump, seen as a pro-business choice, to worries about the rate cut path and potential inflation risks under the next administration.

For the week, the S&P 500 fell 2.08% while the Nasdaq declined 3.15%, marking their biggest weekly losses in more than two months. The Dow fell 1.24% for the week.

"Volumes are elevated today. People are taking profits because this has been a good month. U.S. stocks have been doing well this month. But it's not blanket profit taking," said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank, pointing to gains in the Utilities sector. "This suggests more of a rotation."

Stocks of vaccine makers and packaged food companies also dipped after Trump said he would nominate Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has spread misinformation on vaccines and criticized ultra-processed foods, to head the Department of Health and Human Services.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 305.87 points, or 0.70%, to 43,444.99, the S&P 500 lost 78.55 points, or 1.32%, to 5,870.62 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 427.53 points, or 2.24%, to 18,680.12.

The small-cap Russell 2000 index ended down 1.4%, its fourth consecutive session of losses.

Shares of defense firms and government contractors also fell, partly on concerns about Trump's picks earlier this week to head a new Department of Government Efficiency.

Among the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors information technology was the day's biggest loser, dropping 2.5%.

Also, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index fell 3.4% with Applied Materials tumbling 9.2% after the U.S. maker of chip-manufacturing equipment forecast first-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates.

Shares in Moderna dropped 7.3% and Pfizer (PFE.N), opens new tab fell 4.7%, weighing on healthcare, which closed down 1.88% after hitting its lowest since May in its fifth straight day of declines.

The Consumer staples index, which finished off 0.8%, was also hurt by the nomination news. Among its biggest decliners, Monster Beverage fell 7%, Lamb Weston lost 6% and Keurig Dr Pepper dropped 5% to its lowest level since April.

Adding to Friday's volatility was the regular expiration of stock and index options, according to Vaughan Nelson's Rich.

Brent Kochuba, founder of financial insights company SpotGamma, said Friday's stock market weakness was partly due to investors being ill-prepared for a pullback.

CBOE's volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, hit 17.55 earlier on Friday, the highest since Election Day on Nov. 5. However the index pared gains to close at 16.14.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.89-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 117 new highs and 108 new lows.

On the Nasdaq, 1,241 stocks rose and 3,115 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.51-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 25 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 285 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 15.47 billion shares changed hands compared with the 13.94 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

    TITLE: Wall Street sinks on Powell rate-cut caution, Trump cabinet picks
    EXTRACTION METHOD: newspaper3k

    SUMMARY:
    Wall Street

Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notching their biggest one-day losses in two weeks, on concerns about slower interest-rate cuts and as investors reacted to cabinet picks by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday cited ongoing economic growth, a solid job market, and inflation above the U.S. central bank's 2% target as reasons it can afford to be careful with the pace and scope of future rate cuts.

Traders increased bets the Fed will not change rates at its December meeting, pricing in a roughly 42% chance, versus roughly 14% a month ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool. They also dialed back expectations for easing in 2025.

This view was reinforced by Friday's economic data showing U.S. retail sales rose slightly more than expected in October. Import prices also rebounded and data released on Wednesday and Thursday showed sticky inflation.

A column chart titled "Monthly change in US retail sales" that tracks the metric over the last year. Retail sales rose 0.4% in October.

"In the last 48 hours we've had some pretty big changes, not just from the election but from economic data that was better than expected and Powell speaking about not having to be as aggressive on interest rate cuts," said Adam Rich, deputy chief investment officer for Vaughan Nelson in Houston.

"Market expectations for interest rate cuts have come down materially and also the market is readjusting after a pretty bullish reaction to the U.S. election."

Friday's sell-off ended a week in which market focus shifted from the U.S. election win by Trump, seen as a pro-business choice, to worries about the rate cut path and potential inflation risks under the next administration.

For the week, the S&P 500 fell 2.08% while the Nasdaq declined 3.15%, marking their biggest weekly losses in more than two months. The Dow fell 1.24% for the week.

"Volumes are elevated today. People are taking profits because this has been a good month. U.S. stocks have been doing well this month. But it's not blanket profit taking," said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank, pointing to gains in the Utilities sector. "This suggests more of a rotation."

Stocks of vaccine makers and packaged food companies also dipped after Trump said he would nominate Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has spread misinformation on vaccines and criticized ultra-processed foods, to head the Department of Health and Human Services.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 305.87 points, or 0.70%, to 43,444.99, the S&P 500 lost 78.55 points, or 1.32%, to 5,870.62 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 427.53 points, or 2.24%, to 18,680.12.

The small-cap Russell 2000 index ended down 1.4%, its fourth consecutive session of losses.

Shares of defense firms and government contractors also fell, partly on concerns about Trump's picks earlier this week to head a new Department of Government Efficiency.

Among the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors information technology was the day's biggest loser, dropping 2.5%.

Also, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index fell 3.4% with Applied Materials tumbling 9.2% after the U.S. maker of chip-manufacturing equipment forecast first-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates.

Shares in Moderna dropped 7.3% and Pfizer (PFE.N), opens new tab fell 4.7%, weighing on healthcare, which closed down 1.88% after hitting its lowest since May in its fifth straight day of declines.

The Consumer staples index, which finished off 0.8%, was also hurt by the nomination news. Among its biggest decliners, Monster Beverage fell 7%, Lamb Weston lost 6% and Keurig Dr Pepper dropped 5% to its lowest level since April.

Adding to Friday's volatility was the regular expiration of stock and index options, according to Vaughan Nelson's Rich.

Brent Kochuba, founder of financial insights company SpotGamma, said Friday's stock market weakness was partly due to investors being ill-prepared for a pullback.

CBOE's volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, hit 17.55 earlier on Friday, the highest since Election Day on Nov. 5. However the index pared gains to close at 16.14.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.89-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 117 new highs and 108 new lows.

On the Nasdaq, 1,241 stocks rose and 3,115 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.51-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 25 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 285 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 15.47 billion shares changed hands compared with the 13.94 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

    Summary: 
    Wall Street

Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notching their biggest one-day losses in two weeks, on concerns about slower interest-rate cuts and as investors reacted to cabinet picks by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday cited ongoing economic growth, a solid job market, and inflation above the U.S. central bank's 2% target as reasons it can afford to be careful with the pace and scope of future rate cuts.

Traders increased bets the Fed will not change rates at its December meeting, pricing in a roughly 42% chance, versus roughly 14% a month ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool. They also dialed back expectations for easing in 2025.

This view was reinforced by Friday's economic data showing U.S. retail sales rose slightly more than expected in October. Import prices also rebounded and data released on Wednesday and Thursday showed sticky inflation.

A column chart titled "Monthly change in US retail sales" that tracks the metric over the last year. Retail sales rose 0.4% in October.

"In the last 48 hours we've had some pretty big changes, not just from the election but from economic data that was better than expected and Powell speaking about not having to be as aggressive on interest rate cuts," said Adam Rich, deputy chief investment officer for Vaughan Nelson in Houston.

"Market expectations for interest rate cuts have come down materially and also the market is readjusting after a pretty bullish reaction to the U.S. election."

Friday's sell-off ended a week in which market focus shifted from the U.S. election win by Trump, seen as a pro-business choice, to worries about the rate cut path and potential inflation risks under the next administration.

For the week, the S&P 500 fell 2.08% while the Nasdaq declined 3.15%, marking their biggest weekly losses in more than two months. The Dow fell 1.24% for the week.

"Volumes are elevated today. People are taking profits because this has been a good month. U.S. stocks have been doing well this month. But it's not blanket profit taking," said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank, pointing to gains in the Utilities sector. "This suggests more of a rotation."

Stocks of vaccine makers and packaged food companies also dipped after Trump said he would nominate Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has spread misinformation on vaccines and criticized ultra-processed foods, to head the Department of Health and Human Services.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 305.87 points, or 0.70%, to 43,444.99, the S&P 500 lost 78.55 points, or 1.32%, to 5,870.62 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 427.53 points, or 2.24%, to 18,680.12.

The small-cap Russell 2000 index ended down 1.4%, its fourth consecutive session of losses.

Shares of defense firms and government contractors also fell, partly on concerns about Trump's picks earlier this week to head a new Department of Government Efficiency.

Among the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors information technology was the day's biggest loser, dropping 2.5%.

Also, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index fell 3.4% with Applied Materials tumbling 9.2% after the U.S. maker of chip-manufacturing equipment forecast first-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates.

Shares in Moderna dropped 7.3% and Pfizer (PFE.N), opens new tab fell 4.7%, weighing on healthcare, which closed down 1.88% after hitting its lowest since May in its fifth straight day of declines.

The Consumer staples index, which finished off 0.8%, was also hurt by the nomination news. Among its biggest decliners, Monster Beverage fell 7%, Lamb Weston lost 6% and Keurig Dr Pepper dropped 5% to its lowest level since April.

Adding to Friday's volatility was the regular expiration of stock and index options, according to Vaughan Nelson's Rich.

Brent Kochuba, founder of financial insights company SpotGamma, said Friday's stock market weakness was partly due to investors being ill-prepared for a pullback.

CBOE's volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, hit 17.55 earlier on Friday, the highest since Election Day on Nov. 5. However the index pared gains to close at 16.14.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.89-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 117 new highs and 108 new lows.

On the Nasdaq, 1,241 stocks rose and 3,115 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.51-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 25 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 285 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 15.47 billion shares changed hands compared with the 13.94 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

- All three major indexes started the day lower, with the benchmark index dropping as much as about 0.6% after Russian President Vladimir Putin lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike in response to a broader range of conventional attacks earlier in the day, and Moscow said Ukraine had struck deep inside Russia with U.S.-made long-range missiles.

    Summary: 
    Wall Street

Wall Street's main indexes closed lower on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notching their biggest one-day losses in two weeks, on concerns about slower interest-rate cuts and as investors reacted to cabinet picks by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday cited ongoing economic growth, a solid job market, and inflation above the U.S. central bank's 2% target as reasons it can afford to be careful with the pace and scope of future rate cuts.

Traders increased bets the Fed will not change rates at its December meeting, pricing in a roughly 42% chance, versus roughly 14% a month ago, according to the CME FedWatch tool. They also dialed back expectations for easing in 2025.

This view was reinforced by Friday's economic data showing U.S. retail sales rose slightly more than expected in October. Import prices also rebounded and data released on Wednesday and Thursday showed sticky inflation.

A column chart titled "Monthly change in US retail sales" that tracks the metric over the last year. Retail sales rose 0.4% in October.

"In the last 48 hours we've had some pretty big changes, not just from the election but from economic data that was better than expected and Powell speaking about not having to be as aggressive on interest rate cuts," said Adam Rich, deputy chief investment officer for Vaughan Nelson in Houston.

"Market expectations for interest rate cuts have come down materially and also the market is readjusting after a pretty bullish reaction to the U.S. election."

Friday's sell-off ended a week in which market focus shifted from the U.S. election win by Trump, seen as a pro-business choice, to worries about the rate cut path and potential inflation risks under the next administration.

For the week, the S&P 500 fell 2.08% while the Nasdaq declined 3.15%, marking their biggest weekly losses in more than two months. The Dow fell 1.24% for the week.

"Volumes are elevated today. People are taking profits because this has been a good month. U.S. stocks have been doing well this month. But it's not blanket profit taking," said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank, pointing to gains in the Utilities sector. "This suggests more of a rotation."

Stocks of vaccine makers and packaged food companies also dipped after Trump said he would nominate Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has spread misinformation on vaccines and criticized ultra-processed foods, to head the Department of Health and Human Services.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 305.87 points, or 0.70%, to 43,444.99, the S&P 500 lost 78.55 points, or 1.32%, to 5,870.62 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 427.53 points, or 2.24%, to 18,680.12.

The small-cap Russell 2000 index ended down 1.4%, its fourth consecutive session of losses.

Shares of defense firms and government contractors also fell, partly on concerns about Trump's picks earlier this week to head a new Department of Government Efficiency.

Among the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors information technology was the day's biggest loser, dropping 2.5%.

Also, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index fell 3.4% with Applied Materials tumbling 9.2% after the U.S. maker of chip-manufacturing equipment forecast first-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates.

Shares in Moderna dropped 7.3% and Pfizer (PFE.N), opens new tab fell 4.7%, weighing on healthcare, which closed down 1.88% after hitting its lowest since May in its fifth straight day of declines.

The Consumer staples index, which finished off 0.8%, was also hurt by the nomination news. Among its biggest decliners, Monster Beverage fell 7%, Lamb Weston lost 6% and Keurig Dr Pepper dropped 5% to its lowest level since April.

Adding to Friday's volatility was the regular expiration of stock and index options, according to Vaughan Nelson's Rich.

Brent Kochuba, founder of financial insights company SpotGamma, said Friday's stock market weakness was partly due to investors being ill-prepared for a pullback.

CBOE's volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, hit 17.55 earlier on Friday, the highest since Election Day on Nov. 5. However the index pared gains to close at 16.14.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.89-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 117 new highs and 108 new lows.

On the Nasdaq, 1,241 stocks rose and 3,115 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.51-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 25 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 285 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 15.47 billion shares changed hands compared with the 13.94 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 305.87 points, or 0.70%, to 43,444.99, the S&P 500 lost 78.55 points, or 1.32%, to 5,870.62 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 427.53 points, or 2.24%, to 18,680.12.

The small-cap Russell 2000 index ended down 1.4%, its fourth consecutive session of losses.

Shares of defense firms and government contractors also fell, partly on concerns about Trump's picks earlier this week to head a new Department of Government Efficiency.

Among the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors information technology was the day's biggest loser, dropping 2.5%.

Also, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index fell 3.4% with Applied Materials tumbling 9.2% after the U.S. maker of chip-manufacturing equipment forecast first-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates.

Shares in Moderna dropped 7.3% and Pfizer (PFE.N), opens new tab fell 4.7%, weighing on healthcare, which closed down 1.88% after hitting its lowest since May in its fifth straight day of declines.

The Consumer staples index, which finished off 0.8%, was also hurt by the nomination news. Among its biggest decliners, Monster Beverage fell 7%, Lamb Weston lost 6% and Keurig Dr Pepper dropped 5% to its lowest level since April.

Adding to Friday's volatility was the regular expiration of stock and index options, according to Vaughan Nelson's Rich.

Brent Kochuba, founder of financial insights company SpotGamma, said Friday's stock market weakness was partly due to investors being ill-prepared for a pullback.

CBOE's volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, hit 17.55 earlier on Friday, the highest since Election Day on Nov. 5. However the index pared gains to close at 16.14.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.89-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 117 new highs and 108 new lows.

On the Nasdaq, 1,241 stocks rose and 3,115 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.51-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 25 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 285 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 15.47 billion shares changed hands compared with the 13.94 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

"Market expectations for interest rate cuts have come down materially and also the market is readjusting after a pretty bullish reaction to the U

Friday's sell-off ended a week in which market focus shifted from the U
 election win by Trump, seen as a pro-business choice, to worries about the rate cut path and potential inflation risks under the next administration

Also, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index fell 3


The Consumer staples index, which finished off 0

"One of the components that was important for the market was that it said more of their customers are going in and purchasing items in the higher margin categories, which is something that has been watched
