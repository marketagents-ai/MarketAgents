Below are detailed TOML prompts for each individual reasoning step of an AI agent using a chain-of-thought approach. Each step is broken down into a specific task, with clear instructions, input, expected output, and additional settings where relevant. This provides granular control and guidance for each stage of the reasoning process.

- **Input Type and Expected Output**: Specifies the input format and what is expected as output.
- **Actions**: Details specific actions to perform for achieving the step's objective.
- **Error Handling**: Defines strategies for managing errors specific to each step.
- **Additional Settings**: Customizes actions and responses based on criteria like user preferences and performance requirements.

Certainly! Below are **JSON Lines (JSONL) templates for each reasoning step** of the AI Assistant's chain-of-thought process. Each JSON object represents a distinct reasoning step, including placeholders for inputs and outputs. These templates can be used to structure and standardize the reasoning process within your system.

```json
{"step_number": 1, "action": "Comprehend the user's question.", "input": "<User's question or query here>", "output": "<Understanding of the user's question>"}
{"step_number": 2, "action": "Identify key concepts and entities.", "input": "<Understanding of the user's question>", "output": "<List of key concepts and entities>"}
{"step_number": 3, "action": "Retrieve relevant knowledge or information.", "input": "<List of key concepts and entities>", "output": "<Relevant knowledge or information gathered>"}
{"step_number": 4, "action": "Evaluate possible solutions or answers.", "input": "<Relevant knowledge or information gathered>", "output": "<Analysis of possible solutions or answers>"}
{"step_number": 5, "action": "Select the most appropriate response based on relevance and accuracy.", "input": "<Analysis of possible solutions or answers>", "output": "<Chosen solution or answer>"}
{"step_number": 6, "action": "Structure the response logically, ensuring it flows coherently.", "input": "<Chosen solution or answer>", "output": "<Logically structured response>"}
{"step_number": 7, "action": "Review the response for accuracy, completeness, and clarity.", "input": "<Logically structured response>", "output": "<Reviewed and refined response>"}
{"step_number": 8, "action": "Format the response according to user preferences and context.", "input": "<Reviewed and refined response>", "output": "<Final formatted response>"}
```

### Explanation of the Templates:

1. **Step Number (`step_number`)**:
   - Indicates the sequence of the reasoning process, ensuring each step is followed in order.

2. **Action (`action`)**:
   - Describes the specific task or objective of the reasoning step.

3. **Input (`input`)**:
   - Represents the data or information received from the previous step or the initial user query.
   - **Placeholder**: `<...>` denotes where actual data should be inserted during processing.

4. **Output (`output`)**:
   - The result or outcome produced after performing the action on the input.
   - **Placeholder**: `<...>` denotes where the processed data or conclusions will be placed.

### Example Usage:

Suppose a user asks, "What are the health benefits of regular exercise?" Here's how each template would be utilized:

1. **Comprehend the user's question.**
   ```json
   {"step_number": 1, "action": "Comprehend the user's question.", "input": "What are the health benefits of regular exercise?", "output": "Understanding that the user is seeking information on the various health advantages associated with consistent physical activity."}
   ```

2. **Identify key concepts and entities.**
   ```json
   {"step_number": 2, "action": "Identify key concepts and entities.", "input": "Understanding that the user is seeking information on the various health advantages associated with consistent physical activity.", "output": ["health benefits", "regular exercise", "physical activity"]}
   ```

3. **Retrieve relevant knowledge or information.**
   ```json
   {"step_number": 3, "action": "Retrieve relevant knowledge or information.", "input": ["health benefits", "regular exercise", "physical activity"], "output": ["Improves cardiovascular health", "Enhances mental well-being", "Aids in weight management", "Strengthens muscles and bones", "Boosts immune system"]}
   ```

4. **Evaluate possible solutions or answers.**
   ```json
   {"step_number": 4, "action": "Evaluate possible solutions or answers.", "input": ["Improves cardiovascular health", "Enhances mental well-being", "Aids in weight management", "Strengthens muscles and bones", "Boosts immune system"], "output": "Assessing the credibility and relevance of each listed benefit based on scientific research and user context."}
   ```

5. **Select the most appropriate response based on relevance and accuracy.**
   ```json
   {"step_number": 5, "action": "Select the most appropriate response based on relevance and accuracy.", "input": "Assessing the credibility and relevance of each listed benefit based on scientific research and user context.", "output": ["Improves cardiovascular health", "Enhances mental well-being", "Aids in weight management"]}
   ```

6. **Structure the response logically, ensuring it flows coherently.**
   ```json
   {"step_number": 6, "action": "Structure the response logically, ensuring it flows coherently.", "input": ["Improves cardiovascular health", "Enhances mental well-being", "Aids in weight management"], "output": "Regular exercise offers numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, enhanced mental well-being, and effective weight management."}
   ```

7. **Review the response for accuracy, completeness, and clarity.**
   ```json
   {"step_number": 7, "action": "Review the response for accuracy, completeness, and clarity.", "input": "Regular exercise offers numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, enhanced mental well-being, and effective weight management.", "output": "Reviewed and confirmed that the response accurately reflects key health benefits of regular exercise, is complete, and clearly articulated."}
   ```

8. **Format the response according to user preferences and context.**
   ```json
   {"step_number": 8, "action": "Format the response according to user preferences and context.", "input": "Reviewed and confirmed that the response accurately reflects key health benefits of regular exercise, is complete, and clearly articulated.", "output": "Sure! Here are some key health benefits of regular exercise:\n\n1. **Improves Cardiovascular Health**: Enhances heart and lung function.\n2. **Enhances Mental Well-Being**: Reduces stress and improves mood.\n3. **Aids in Weight Management**: Helps maintain a healthy weight."}
   ```

### Benefits of Using JSONL Templates:

- **Standardization**: Ensures each reasoning step follows a consistent format, making the process predictable and manageable.
- **Automation**: Facilitates automated processing and integration with systems that can parse JSONL, enabling streamlined workflows.
- **Scalability**: Easily accommodates additional reasoning steps or modifications without disrupting the existing structure.
- **Clarity**: Provides clear separation of each reasoning phase, enhancing transparency and debuggability.

### Implementation Tips:

1. **Dynamic Population**:
   - Replace the `<...>` placeholders with actual data during each step of the reasoning process.
   - Ensure that each step's output seamlessly feeds into the next step's input.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Incorporate mechanisms to handle cases where a step might not produce the expected output, such as retries or fallback procedures.

3. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Maintain logs of each reasoning step's inputs and outputs for auditing, debugging, and improving the reasoning process.

4. **Customization**:
   - Adapt the templates to include additional metadata or context-specific information as needed for your application's requirements.
