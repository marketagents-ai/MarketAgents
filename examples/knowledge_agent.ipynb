Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process\\nof “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings\\nin language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,\\nnew. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a\\nmile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds. These expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource\\nfor study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment.', 'By making the classic\\ntexts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as The\\nFolger Shakespeare (formerly Folger Digital Texts), we place a\\ntrusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them. The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis\\nfor the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their\\norigin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the\\nsingle greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An\\nunparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and\\nartwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been\\nconsulted extensively in the preparation of these texts.', 'The Editions\\nalso reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of\\nShakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theatre. I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul\\nWerstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s\\nworks, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a\\nrichness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers\\nwho want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow\\nthe paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the\\nFolger either in-person or online, where a range of physical and\\ndigital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts.', 'I\\ncommend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.From the Director of the Folger Shakespeare\\nLibraryUntil now, with the release of The Folger Shakespeare (formerly\\nFolger Digital Texts), readers in search of a free online text of\\nShakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the\\nMoby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of\\nthe plays. What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that\\nthere is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But\\nShakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or\\nplays are published today: as a single, authoritative text.', 'In some\\ncases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published\\nversions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great\\ncollection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First\\nFolio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of\\nHamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others. Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then\\namend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other\\nversions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate\\ntext.', 'Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an\\nunfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the\\nperiod or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that\\nmade it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred\\nyears of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on\\ncultural preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created,\\nfor example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda\\nto chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The\\nTempest, 1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not\\ntake,/Being capable of all ill!', 'I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare\\neditors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her\\nfather, Prospero. The editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long\\nbefore scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to\\nmake the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The\\nFolger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger\\nShakespeare texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly\\ntransparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™,\\nwhich hide editorial interventions.', 'The reader of the Folger\\nShakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial\\ninterventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from\\nOthello: “If she in chains of magic were not bound,”), half-square\\nbrackets (for example, from Henry V: “With blood and sword and\\nfire to win your right,”), or angle brackets (for example, fromTextual Introduction\\nBy Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine\\nHamlet: “O farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved/you?”). At\\nany point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for\\nmore information.', 'Because the Folger Shakespeare texts are edited in accord with\\ntwenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger\\nhere provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors,\\nand students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the\\nplays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study\\nand enjoyment of Shakespeare. Events before the start of Hamlet set the stage for tragedy. When the\\nking of Denmark, Prince Hamlet’s father, suddenly dies, Hamlet’s\\nmother, Gertrude, marries his uncle Claudius, who becomes the new\\nking.', 'A spirit who claims to be the ghost of Hamlet’s father describes his\\nmurder at the hands of Claudius and demands that Hamlet avenge\\nthe killing. When the councilor Polonius learns from his daughter,\\nOphelia, that Hamlet has visited her in an apparently distracted state,\\nPolonius attributes the prince’s condition to lovesickness, and he sets\\na trap for Hamlet using Ophelia as bait. To confirm Claudius’s guilt, Hamlet arranges for a play that mimics\\nthe murder; Claudius’s reaction is that of a guilty man. Hamlet, now\\nfree to act, mistakenly kills Polonius, thinking he is Claudius.', 'Claudius sends Hamlet away as part of a deadly plot. After Polonius’s death, Ophelia goes mad and later drowns. Hamlet,\\nwho has returned safely to confront the king, agrees to a fencing\\nmatch with Ophelia’s brother, Laertes, who secretly poisons his own\\nrapier. At the match, Claudius prepares poisoned wine for Hamlet,\\nwhich Gertrude unknowingly drinks; as she dies, she accuses\\nClaudius, whom Hamlet kills.', 'Then first Laertes and then Hamlet\\ndie, both victims of Laertes’ rapier.SynopsisTHE GHOST\\nHAMLET, Prince of Denmark, son of the late King Hamlet\\n and Queen Gertrude\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE, widow of King Hamlet, now married to Claudius\\nKING CLAUDIUS, brother to the late King Hamlet\\nOPHELIA\\nLAERTES, her brother\\nPOLONIUS, father of Ophelia and Laertes, councillor to King Claudius\\nREYNALDO, servant to Polonius\\nHORATIO, Hamlet’s friend and confidant\\nFORTINBRAS, Prince of Norway\\nA Captain in Fortinbras’s army\\nAmbassadors to Denmark from England\\nPlayers who take the roles of Prologue, Player King, Player Queen,\\nand Lucianus in The Murder of Gonzago\\nTwo Messengers\\nSailors\\nGravedigger\\nGravedigger’s companion\\nDoctor of Divinity\\nAttendants, Lords, Guards, Musicians, Laertes’s Followers, Soldiers,\\nOfficersCharacters in the Play\\ncourtiers at the Danish courtVOLTEMAND\\nCORNELIUS\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nOSRIC\\nGentlemen\\nA Lord\\nDanish soldiersFRANCISCO\\nBARNARDO\\nMARCELLUS\\nBARNARDO\\nFRANCISCO\\nBARNARDO\\nFRANCISCO\\nBARNARDO\\nFRANCISCO\\nBARNARDO\\nFRANCISCO\\nBARNARDO\\nFRANCISCO\\nBARNARDO\\nFRANCISCO\\nHORATIOEnter Barnardo and Francisco, two sentinels.', 'Who’s there?
