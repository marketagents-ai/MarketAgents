      "{'text': 'A discussion\\nregarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, which is available free of charge on the SEC’ s website at\\nhttp://www .sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor .nvidia.com.\\n\\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue.', 'similarity': 0.7589333900928734, 'context': '...a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on histor ical return rates. However , if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,\\nwe may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking\\ndistributors for specific products are contractuall y limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow\\nreturns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, or MDFs, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs\\nbased on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for\\nspecific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicabl e incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program\\naccruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.\\nLicense and Development Arrangements\\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting\\nperiod, we measure progress to completion base d on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.\\nEstimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.\\nTable of Contents\\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts may conta in more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer\\ncontract is distinct. Exce pt for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA  products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a\\nsignificant amount of integration or interdepende ncy. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct\\nand are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple performance obligations on a relative standalone\\nselling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in\\ncomparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service\\nseparately , we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.\\nResults of Operations\\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 is presented below . A discussion\\nregarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, which is available free of charge on the SEC’ s website at\\nhttp://www .sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor .nvidia.com.\\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue. \\n  Year Ended\\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024\\nRevenue 100.0 % 100.0 %\\nCost of revenue 25.0 27.3 \\nGross profit 75.0 72.7 \\nOperating expenses  \\nResearch and development 9.9 14.2 \\nSales, general and administrative 2.7 4.4 \\nTotal operating expenses 12.6 18.6 \\nOperating income 62.4 54.1 \\nInterest income 1.4 1.4 \\nInterest expense (0.2) (0.4)\\nOther , net 0.8 0.4 \\nOther income (expense), net 2.0 1.4 \\nIncome before income tax 64.4 55.5 \\nIncome tax expense 8.6 6.6 \\nNet income 55.8 % 48.9 %\\nTable of Contents\\nReportable Segments\\nRevenue by Reportable Segments\\nYear Ended\\nJan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024$\\nChange%\\nChange\\n($ in millions)\\nCompute & Networking $ 116,193 $ 47,405 $ 68,788 145 %\\nGraphics 14,304 13,517 787 6 %\\nTotal $ 130,497 $ 60,922 $ 69,575 114 %\\nOperating Income by Reportable Segments\\nYear Ended\\nJan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024$\\nChange%\\nChange\\n($ in millions)\\nCompute & Networking $ 82,875 $ 32,016 $ 50,859 159 %\\nGraphics 5,085 5,846 (761) (13)%\\nAll Other (6,507) (4,890) (1,617) 33 %\\nTotal $ 81,453 $ 32,972 $ 48,481 147 %\\nCompute & Networking revenue  – The year over year increase was due to strong demand for our accelerated computing and AI solutions. Revenue from Data\\nCenter computing grew 162% driven primarily by demand for our Hopper computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and\\ngenerative AI applications. Revenue from Data Center networking grew 51% driven by Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet\\nplatform.\\nGraphics revenue – The year over year increase was driven by sales of our GeForce R TX 40 Series GPUs.\\nReportable segment operating income  – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income was driven by growth in revenue. The\\nyear over year decrease  in Graphics segment operating income was driven by an increase of 44% in segment operating expenses, partially offset by growth in\\nrevenue.\\nAll Other operating loss – The year over year increase was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense reflecting employee growth and\\ncompensation increases.\\nConcentration of Revenue\\nWe refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA  as direct customers, such as AIBs, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and system integrators. We\\nhave certain  customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA  and may use either internal resources or third-party system integrators to complete\\ntheir build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs, consumer internet\\ncompanies, enterprises, and public sector entities.\\nDirect Custo mers  – Sales to direct custo mers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were primarily attributable to the Compute &\\nNetworking segment, are presented in the following table:\\nYear Ended\\nJan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024\\nDirect Customer A 12 % *\\nDirect Customer B 11 % 13 %\\nDirect Customer C 11 % *\\n* Less than 10% of total revenue.\\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2023.\\nTable of Contents\\nIndirect Customers  – Indirect customer revenue is an estimatio n based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product\\nspecifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may differ from our estimates. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect customer\\nwhich prima rily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customer B, is estimated to represent 10% or more\\nof total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\\nWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.\\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to indirect customers in a different location.\\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53% and 56% of total revenue for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively .\\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\\nGross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,\\nassembly , testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test\\nyield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related\\nintangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangement s, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to\\npersonnel associated with manufacturing operations.\\nGross margi ns increased to 75.0% in fiscal year 2025 from 72.7% in fiscal year 2024. The year over year increase was primarily driven by a higher mix of Data\\nCenter revenue.\\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $3.7 billion and $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respecti...'}\n",

Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \\nThe followin g discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” our\\nConsolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold, or sell shares of our common stock. \\nOverview\\nOur Company and Our Businesses\\nNVIDIA  pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have\\nexpanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the\\ngaming market, NVIDIA  has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin\\napplications.\\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,\\nItem 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA  was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\\nDemand and Supply\\nRevenue growth in fiscal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions. Demand for our\\nHopper architecture drove our significant growth for the full year. We began shipping productio n systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of\\nfiscal year 2025.\\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to\\ngenerate significant revenue from them. Advan cements in accelerated computing and generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and\\nscale, have driven increased demand for our Data Center systems.\\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity  purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing complexity of our\\ndata center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both\\ncurrent and future products. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates more\\ncomplexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component\\ncompatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our\\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\nProduct T ransitions and New Product Introductions\\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support\\nnew products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive\\nproducts. The computing industry is experiencing  a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of\\nAI opportuni ties. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Cente r solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions\\neach year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges asso ciated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. The increased\\nfrequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty , or other\\ncosts or result in product delays. We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact\\nour ability to develop other products or adequa tely manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the\\nfrequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost.\\nWhile we have managed  prior product transition s and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our\\nability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\\nGlobal T rade\\nIn August 2022, the USG  announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia\\nof our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\nTable...'}\n",

Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer\\ncontract is distinct. Exce pt for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA  products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a\\nsignificant amount of integration or interdepende ncy. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct\\nand are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple performance obligations on a relative standalone\\nselling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in\\ncomparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service\\nseparately , we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.\\nResults of Operations\\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 is presented below . A discussion\\nregarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, which is available free of charge on the SEC’ s website at\\nhttp://www .sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor .nvidia.com.\\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue. \\n  Year Ended\\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024\\nRevenue 100.0 % 100.0 %\\nCost of revenue 25.0 27.3 \\nGross profit 75.0 72.7 \\nOperating expenses  \\nResearch and development 9.9 14.2 \\nSales, general and administrative 2.7 4.4 \\nTotal operating expenses 12.6 18.6 \\nOperating income 62.4 54.1 \\nInterest income 1.4 1.4 \\nInterest expense (0.2) (0.4)\\nOther , net 0.8 0.4 \\nOther income (expense), net 2.0 1.4 \\nIncome before income tax 64.4 55.5 \\nIncome tax expense 8.6 6.6 \\nNet income 55.8 % 48.9 %\\nTable of Contents\\nReportable Segments\\nRevenue by Reportable Segments\\nYear Ended\\nJan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024$\\nChange%\\nChange\\n($ in millions)\\nCompute & Networking $ 116,193 $ 47,405 $ 68,788 145 %\\nGraphics 14,304 13,517 787 6 %\\nTotal $ 130,497 $ 60,922 $ 69,575 114 %\\nOperating Income by Reportable Segments\\nYear Ended\\nJan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024$\\nChange%\\nChange\\n($ in millions)\\nCompute & Networking $ 82,875 $ 32,016 $ 50,859 159 %\\nGraphics 5,085 5,846 (761) (13)%\\nAll Other (6,507) (4,890) (1,617) 33 %\\nTotal $ 81,453 $ 32,972 $ 48,481 147 %\\nCompute & Networking revenue  – The year over year increase was due to strong demand for our accelerated computing and AI solutions. Revenue from Data\\nCenter computing grew 162% driven primarily by demand for our Hopper computing platform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and\\ngenerative AI applications. Revenue from Data Center networking grew 51% driven by Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet\\nplatform.\\nGraphics revenue – The year over year increase was driven by sales of our GeForce R TX 40 Series GPUs.\\nReportable segment operating income  – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income was driven by growth in revenue. The\\nyear over year decrease  in Graphics segment operating income was driven by an increase of 44% in segment operating expenses, partially offset by growth in\\nrevenue.\\nAll Other operating loss – The year over year increase was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense reflecting employee growth and\\ncompensation increases.\\nConcentration of Revenue\\nWe refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA  as direct customers, such as AIBs, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, and system integrators. We\\nhave certain  customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA  and may use either internal resources or third-party system integrators to complete\\ntheir build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs, consumer internet\\ncompanies, enterprises, and public sector entities.\\nDirect Custo mers  – Sales to direct custo mers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were primarily attributable to the Compute &\\nNetworking segment, are presented in the following table:\\nYear Ended\\nJan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024\\nDirect Customer A 12 % *\\nDirect Customer B 11 % 13 %\\nDirect Customer C 11 % *\\n* Less than 10% of total revenue.\\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2023.\\nTable of Contents\\nIndirect Customers  – Indirect customer revenue is an estimatio n based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product\\nspecifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may differ from our estimates. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect customer\\nwhich prima rily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customer B, is estimated to represent 10% or more\\nof total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\\nWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.\\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to indirect customers in a different location.\\nRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53% and 56% of total revenue for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively .\\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\\nGross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication,\\nassembly , testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test\\nyield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related\\nintangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangement s, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to\\npersonnel associated with manufacturing operations.\\nGross margi ns increased to 75.0% in fiscal year 2025 from 72.7% in fiscal year 2024. The year over year increase was primarily driven by a higher mix of Data\\nCenter revenue.\\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $3.7 billion and $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively . Sales of\\npreviously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $689 million and $540 million for fiscal\\nyears 2025 and 2024, respectively . The net ef fect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.3% and 2.7% in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively .\\nOperating Expenses\\n Year Ended\\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024$\\nChange%\\nChange\\n ($ in millions)\\nResearch and development expenses $ 12,914 $ 8,675 $ 4,239 49 %\\n% of net revenue 9.9 % 14.2 %  \\nSales, general and administrative expenses 3,491 2,654 837 32 %\\n% of net revenue 2.7 % 4.4 %  \\nTotal operating expenses $ 16,405 $ 11,329 $ 5,076 45 %\\n% of net revenue 12.6 % 18.6 %\\nThe increases in research and development expenses for fiscal year 2025 were driven by a 32% increase in compensation and benefits, including stock-based\\ncompensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases, a 100% increase in compute and infrastructure, and a 234% increase in engineering\\ndevelopment costs for new product introductions.\\nThe increases in sales, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2025 were...'}\n",

We also have audited the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025,\\nbased on criteria estab lished in Internal Contr ol - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\\nCommission (COSO).\\nIn our opinion, the conso lidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January\\n, 2025 and January 28, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each  of the three years in the period ended January 26, 2025 in\\nconformity with accounti ng principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025, based on criteria estab lished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued\\nby the COSO.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company\\'s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for main taining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for\\nits assessm ent of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’ s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial\\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’ s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\\'s internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered  with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit s in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\\nassurance about whether the consolidated finan cial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those  risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures  in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control\\nover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. W e believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’ s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’ s internal control over financial\\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of recor ds that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’ s assets that could have a material ef fect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent  limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate beca use of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nTable of Contents\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or\\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and\\n(ii) involved our especia lly challengi...'}\n",

Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have\\nexpanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the\\ngaming market, NVIDIA  has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin\\napplications.\\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,\\nItem 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA  was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\\nDemand and Supply\\nRevenue growth in fiscal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions. Demand for our\\nHopper architecture drove our significant growth for the full year. We began shipping productio n systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of\\nfiscal year 2025.\\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to\\ngenerate significant revenue from them. Advan cements in accelerated computing and generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and\\nscale, have driven increased demand for our Data Center systems.\\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity  purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing complexity of our\\ndata center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both\\ncurrent and future products. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates more\\ncomplexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component\\ncompatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our\\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\nProduct T ransitions and New Product Introductions\\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support\\nnew products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive\\nproducts. The computing industry is experiencing  a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of\\nAI opportuni ties. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Cente r solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions\\neach year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges asso ciated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. The increased\\nfrequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty , or other\\ncosts or result in product delays. We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact\\nour ability to develop other products or adequa tely manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the\\nfrequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost.\\nWhile we have managed  prior product transition s and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our\\nability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\\nGlobal T rade\\nIn August 2022, the USG  announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia\\nof our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\nTable of Contents\\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other\\nregions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\\nChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing\\nrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent\\nheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for\\nshipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period grant ed by the official rule).

Demand for our\\\\nHopper architecture drove our significant growth\\\\\\n    \\\\ for the full year. We began shipping productio n systems of the Blackwell architecture\\\\\\n    \\\\ in the fourth quarter of\\\\nfiscal year 2025.\\\\nDemand estimates for our products,\\\\\\n    \\\\ applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue\\\\\\n    \\\\ or supply levels. We may not be able to\\\\ngenerate significant revenue from them.\\\\\\n    \\\\ Advan cements in accelerated computing and generative AI models, along with\\\\\\n    \\\\ the growth in model complexity and\\\\nscale, have driven increased demand for\\\\\\n    \\\\ our Data Center systems.\\\\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity  purchases\\\\\\n    \\\\ with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing\\\\\\n    \\\\ complexity of our\\\\ndata center products. With these additions, we have also\\\\\\n    \\\\ entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements\\\\\\n    \\\\ to supply both\\\\ncurrent and future products. The increased purchase volumes\\\\\\n    \\\\ and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply\\\\\\n    \\\\ chain creates more\\\\ncomplexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations\\\\\\n    \\\\ in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio\\\\\\n    \\\\ and varying component\\\\ncompatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory\\\\\\n    \\\\ levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or\\\\\\n    \\\\ impairments if our\\\\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand\\\\\\n    \\\\ for our products or demand declines.\\\\nProduct T ransitions and New Product Introductions\\\\n\\\\\\n    Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture\\\\\\n    \\\\ products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support\\\\n\\\\\\n    new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures\\\\\\n    \\\\ of our Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive\\\\nproducts.\\\\\\n    \\\\ The computing industry is experiencing  a broader and faster launch cadence\\\\\\n    \\\\ of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of\\\\nAI\\\\\\n    \\\\ opportuni ties. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of\\\\\\n    \\\\ our Data Cente r solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions\\\\n\\\\\\n    each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased\\\\\\n    \\\\ frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\\\\n\\\\\\n    configurations may magnify the challenges asso ciated with managing our supply\\\\\\n    \\\\ and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. The increased\\\\n\\\\\\n    frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality\\\\\\n    \\\\ or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty , or\\\\\\n    \\\\ other\\\\ncosts or result in product delays. We incur significant engineering development\\\\\\n    \\\\ resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact\\\\n\\\\\\n    our ability to develop other products or adequa tely manage our supply chain cost.\\\\\\n    \\\\ Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the\\\\nfrequency\\\\\\n    \\\\ of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted,\\\\\\n    \\\\ both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost.\\\\nWhile we have\\\\\\n    \\\\ managed  prior product transition s and have sold multiple product architectures\\\\\\n    \\\\ at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our\\\\nability to\\\\\\n    \\\\ predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional\\\\\\n    \\\\ costs.\\\\nGlobal T rade\\\\nIn August 2022, the USG  announced licensing requirements\\\\\\n    \\\\ that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong\\\\\\n    \\\\ and Macau) and Russia\\\\nof our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any\\\\\\n    \\\\ other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\\\n\\\\\\n    Table...\"\\n  similarity: 0.7475811164947297\\n  text: \"Table of Contents\\\\n*$100 invested on 1/26/2020 in stock and in indices, including\\\\\\n    \\\\ reinvestment of dividends.\\\\n\\\\nSource: FactSet financial data and analytics.\\\\n\\\\\\n    \\\\ 1/26/2020 1/31/2021 1/30/2022 1/29/2023 1/28/2024 1/26/2025\\\\nNVIDIA  Corporation\\\\\\n    \\\\ $ 100.00 $ 207.79 $ 365.66 $ 326.34 $ 978.42 $ 2,287.06 \\\\nS&P 500 $ 100.00 $\\\\\\n    \\\\ 114.79 $ 138.90 $ 129.69 $ 158.39 $ 200.32 \\\\nNasdaq 100 $ 100.00 $ 142.64 $\\\\\\n    \\\\ 160.62 $ 136.37 $ 196.94 $ 248.12 \\\\nItem 6.

Demand for our\\\\nHopper architecture drove our significant growth\\\\\\n    \\\\ for the full year. We began shipping productio n systems of the Blackwell architecture\\\\\\n    \\\\ in the fourth quarter of\\\\nfiscal year 2025.\\\\nDemand estimates for our products,\\\\\\n    \\\\ applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue\\\\\\n    \\\\ or supply levels. We may not be able to\\\\ngenerate significant revenue from them.\\\\\\n    \\\\ Advan cements in accelerated computing and generative AI models, along with\\\\\\n    \\\\ the growth in model complexity and\\\\nscale, have driven increased demand for\\\\\\n    \\\\ our Data Center systems.\\\\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity  purchases\\\\\\n    \\\\ with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing\\\\\\n    \\\\ complexity of our\\\\ndata center products. With these additions, we have also\\\\\\n    \\\\ entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements\\\\\\n    \\\\ to supply both\\\\ncurrent and future products. The increased purchase volumes\\\\\\n    \\\\ and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply\\\\\\n    \\\\ chain creates more\\\\ncomplexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations\\\\\\n    \\\\ in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio\\\\\\n    \\\\ and varying component\\\\ncompatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory\\\\\\n    \\\\ levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or\\\\\\n    \\\\ impairments if our\\\\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand\\\\\\n    \\\\ for our products or demand declines.\\\\nProduct T ransitions and New Product Introductions\\\\n\\\\\\n    Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture\\\\\\n    \\\\ products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support\\\\n\\\\\\n    new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures\\\\\\n    \\\\ of our Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive\\\\nproducts.\\\\\\n    \\\\ The computing industry is experiencing  a broader and faster launch cadence\\\\\\n    \\\\ of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of\\\\nAI\\\\\\n    \\\\ opportuni ties. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of\\\\\\n    \\\\ our Data Cente r solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions\\\\n\\\\\\n    each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased\\\\\\n    \\\\ frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\\\\n\\\\\\n    configurations may magnify the challenges asso ciated with managing our supply\\\\\\n    \\\\ and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. The increased\\\\n\\\\\\n    frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality\\\\\\n    \\\\ or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty , or\\\\\\n    \\\\ other\\\\ncosts or result in product delays. We incur significant engineering development\\\\\\n    \\\\ resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact\\\\n\\\\\\n    our ability to develop other products or adequa tely manage our supply chain cost.\\\\\\n    \\\\ Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the\\\\nfrequency\\\\\\n    \\\\ of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted,\\\\\\n    \\\\ both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost.\\\\nWhile we have\\\\\\n    \\\\ managed  prior product transition s and have sold multiple product architectures\\\\\\n    \\\\ at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our\\\\nability to\\\\\\n    \\\\ predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional\\\\\\n    \\\\ costs.\\\\nGlobal T rade\\\\nIn August 2022, the USG  announced licensing requirements\\\\\\n    \\\\ that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong\\\\\\n    \\\\ and Macau) and Russia\\\\nof our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any\\\\\\n    \\\\ other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\\\n\\\\\\n    Table of Contents\\\\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing\\\\\\n    \\\\ requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers\\\\\\n    \\\\ and other\\\\nregions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\\\nIn October\\\\\\n    \\\\ 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective\\\\\\n    \\\\ in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\\\\nChina and Country\\\\\\n    \\\\ Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United\\\\\\n    \\\\ Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\\\\nproducts exceeding\\\\\\n    \\\\ certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800,\\\\\\n    \\\\ H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090.

However ,\\\\\\n    \\\\ if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical\\\\\\n    \\\\ return rates,\\\\nwe may determine that additional sales return allowances are\\\\\\n    \\\\ required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.

For shipments to other\\\\\\n    \\\\ customers, we do not allow\\\\nreturns, although we may approve returns for credit\\\\\\n    \\\\ or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\\\\nWe account for customer\\\\\\n    \\\\ programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, or MDFs, as\\\\\\n    \\\\ a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs\\\\nbased on the amount we\\\\\\n    \\\\ expect to be claimed by customers.

Demand for our\\\\nHopper architecture drove our significant growth\\\\\\n    \\\\ for the full year. We began shipping productio n systems of the Blackwell architecture\\\\\\n    \\\\ in the fourth quarter of\\\\nfiscal year 2025.\\\\nDemand estimates for our products,\\\\\\n    \\\\ applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue\\\\\\n    \\\\ or supply levels. We may not be able to\\\\ngenerate significant revenue from them.\\\\\\n    \\\\ Advan cements in accelerated computing and generative AI models, along with\\\\\\n    \\\\ the growth in model complexity and\\\\nscale, have driven increased demand for\\\\\\n    \\\\ our Data Center systems.\\\\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity  purchases\\\\\\n    \\\\ with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing\\\\\\n    \\\\ complexity of our\\\\ndata center products. With these additions, we have also\\\\\\n    \\\\ entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements\\\\\\n    \\\\ to supply both\\\\ncurrent and future products. The increased purchase volumes\\\\\\n    \\\\ and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply\\\\\\n    \\\\ chain creates more\\\\ncomplexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations\\\\\\n    \\\\ in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio\\\\\\n    \\\\ and varying component\\\\ncompatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory\\\\\\n    \\\\ levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or\\\\\\n    \\\\ impairments if our\\\\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand\\\\\\n    \\\\ for our products or demand declines.\\\\nProduct T ransitions and New Product Introductions\\\\n\\\\\\n    Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture\\\\\\n    \\\\ products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support\\\\n\\\\\\n    new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures\\\\\\n    \\\\ of our Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive\\\\nproducts.\\\\\\n    \\\\ The computing industry is experiencing  a broader and faster launch cadence\\\\\\n    \\\\ of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of\\\\nAI\\\\\\n    \\\\ opportuni ties. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of\\\\\\n    \\\\ our Data Cente r solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions\\\\n\\\\\\n    each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased\\\\\\n    \\\\ frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\\\\n\\\\\\n    configurations may magnify the challenges asso ciated with managing our supply\\\\\\n    \\\\ and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. The increased\\\\n\\\\\\n    frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality\\\\\\n    \\\\ or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty , or\\\\\\n    \\\\ other\\\\ncosts or result in product delays. We incur significant engineering development\\\\\\n    \\\\ resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact\\\\n\\\\\\n    our ability to develop other products or adequa tely manage our supply chain cost.\\\\\\n    \\\\ Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the\\\\nfrequency\\\\\\n    \\\\ of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted,\\\\\\n    \\\\ both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost.\\\\nWhile we have\\\\\\n    \\\\ managed  prior product transition s and have sold multiple product architectures\\\\\\n    \\\\ at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our\\\\nability to\\\\\\n    \\\\ predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional\\\\\\n    \\\\ costs.\\\\nGlobal T rade\\\\nIn August 2022, the USG  announced licensing requirements\\\\\\n    \\\\ that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong\\\\\\n    \\\\ and Macau) and Russia\\\\nof our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any\\\\\\n    \\\\ other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\\\n\\\\\\n    Table...\"\\n  similarity: 0.7475811164947297\\n  text: \"Table of Contents\\\\n*$100 invested on 1/26/2020 in stock and in indices, including\\\\\\n    \\\\ reinvestment of dividends.\\\\n\\\\nSource: FactSet financial data and analytics.\\\\n\\\\\\n    \\\\ 1/26/2020 1/31/2021 1/30/2022 1/29/2023 1/28/2024 1/26/2025\\\\nNVIDIA  Corporation\\\\\\n    \\\\ $ 100.00 $ 207.79 $ 365.66 $ 326.34 $ 978.42 $ 2,287.06 \\\\nS&P 500 $ 100.00 $\\\\\\n    \\\\ 114.79 $ 138.90 $ 129.69 $ 158.39 $ 200.32 \\\\nNasdaq 100 $ 100.00 $ 142.64 $\\\\\\n    \\\\ 160.62 $ 136.37 $ 196.94 $ 248.12 \\\\nItem 6.

Demand for our\\\\nHopper architecture drove our significant growth\\\\\\n    \\\\ for the full year. We began shipping productio n systems of the Blackwell architecture\\\\\\n    \\\\ in the fourth quarter of\\\\nfiscal year 2025.\\\\nDemand estimates for our products,\\\\\\n    \\\\ applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue\\\\\\n    \\\\ or supply levels. We may not be able to\\\\ngenerate significant revenue from them.\\\\\\n    \\\\ Advan cements in accelerated computing and generative AI models, along with\\\\\\n    \\\\ the growth in model complexity and\\\\nscale, have driven increased demand for\\\\\\n    \\\\ our Data Center systems.\\\\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity  purchases\\\\\\n    \\\\ with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing\\\\\\n    \\\\ complexity of our\\\\ndata center products. With these additions, we have also\\\\\\n    \\\\ entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements\\\\\\n    \\\\ to supply both\\\\ncurrent and future products. The increased purchase volumes\\\\\\n    \\\\ and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply\\\\\\n    \\\\ chain creates more\\\\ncomplexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations\\\\\\n    \\\\ in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio\\\\\\n    \\\\ and varying component\\\\ncompatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory\\\\\\n    \\\\ levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or\\\\\\n    \\\\ impairments if our\\\\ninventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand\\\\\\n    \\\\ for our products or demand declines.\\\\nProduct T ransitions and New Product Introductions\\\\n\\\\\\n    Product transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture\\\\\\n    \\\\ products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support\\\\n\\\\\\n    new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures\\\\\\n    \\\\ of our Data Center , Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive\\\\nproducts.\\\\\\n    \\\\ The computing industry is experiencing  a broader and faster launch cadence\\\\\\n    \\\\ of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of\\\\nAI\\\\\\n    \\\\ opportuni ties. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of\\\\\\n    \\\\ our Data Cente r solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions\\\\n\\\\\\n    each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased\\\\\\n    \\\\ frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\\\\n\\\\\\n    configurations may magnify the challenges asso ciated with managing our supply\\\\\\n    \\\\ and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. The increased\\\\n\\\\\\n    frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality\\\\\\n    \\\\ or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty , or\\\\\\n    \\\\ other\\\\ncosts or result in product delays. We incur significant engineering development\\\\\\n    \\\\ resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact\\\\n\\\\\\n    our ability to develop other products or adequa tely manage our supply chain cost.\\\\\\n    \\\\ Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the\\\\nfrequency\\\\\\n    \\\\ of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted,\\\\\\n    \\\\ both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost.\\\\nWhile we have\\\\\\n    \\\\ managed  prior product transition s and have sold multiple product architectures\\\\\\n    \\\\ at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our\\\\nability to\\\\\\n    \\\\ predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional\\\\\\n    \\\\ costs.\\\\nGlobal T rade\\\\nIn August 2022, the USG  announced licensing requirements\\\\\\n    \\\\ that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong\\\\\\n    \\\\ and Macau) and Russia\\\\nof our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any\\\\\\n    \\\\ other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\\\n\\\\\\n    Table of Contents\\\\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing\\\\\\n    \\\\ requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers\\\\\\n    \\\\ and other\\\\nregions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\\\nIn October\\\\\\n    \\\\ 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective\\\\\\n    \\\\ in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\\\\nChina and Country\\\\\\n    \\\\ Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United\\\\\\n    \\\\ Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\\\\nproducts exceeding\\\\\\n    \\\\ certain performance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800,\\\\\\n    \\\\ H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090.
