# Tool Calling Engine TODO

## Integration with Base Agent Module
- [X] Create a new `ToolCallingEngine` class in a separate file (e.g., `tool_calling_engine.py`)
- [X] Implement a method to register tools 
- [ ] Develop a method to parse LLM output and identify tool calls
- [X] Implement error handling for invalid tool calls
- [X] Add a method to execute tool calls and return results
- [ ] Modify the `Agent` class in `agents.py` to initialize and use the `ToolCallingEngine`
- [ ] Update the `execute` method in `Agent` class to handle tool calling scenarios

## Integration with Market Agent Module
- [ ] Define tool schemas for market-specific actions (e.g., post to information board, execute trades, get market history)
- [ ] Implement the corresponding functions for each market-specific tool
- [ ] Modify the `MarketAgent` class in `market_agents.py` to initialize market-specific tools
- [ ] Update the `_generate_llm_bid` method to utilize the tool calling engine when necessary

## Tool Implementation
- [ ] Implement "Post to Information Board" tool
  - [ ] Define schema for posting information
  - [ ] Create function to handle posting to the information board
- [ ] Implement "Execute Trade" tool
  - [ ] Define schema for trade execution
  - [ ] Create function to process and execute trades
- [ ] Implement "Get Market History" tool
  - [ ] Define schema for requesting market history
  - [ ] Create function to retrieve and format market history data

## Testing and Validation
- [ ] Develop unit tests for the `ToolCallingEngine` class
- [ ] Create integration tests for tool calling in the `Agent` class
- [ ] Develop tests for market-specific tools in the `MarketAgent` class
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing of the tool calling process in a simulated market environment

## Documentation and Refactoring
- [ ] Update docstrings and comments for all new and modified classes and methods
- [ ] Refactor existing code to accommodate the new tool calling functionality
- [ ] Update README or documentation to explain the new tool calling feature and its usage

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently used tool results
- [ ] Optimize tool execution to minimize impact on simulation performance
- [ ] Consider implementing parallel tool execution for independent tools

## Security and Permissions
- [ ] Implement a permission system for tool access
- [ ] Ensure that agents can only access tools they are authorized to use
- [ ] Implement logging and auditing for tool usage
