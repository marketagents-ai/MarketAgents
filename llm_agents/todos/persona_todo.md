# Persona Generation for Multi-Agent Market Simulation

## Overview
This document outlines the process for generating diverse personas for Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in a multi-agent market simulation. The goal is to create a wide range of dynamic, realistic personas with demographic characteristics drawn from distributions relevant to economic simulations. These personas will be used to study bounded rational behavior of agents in market scenarios.

## Key Components

1. Demographic Characteristics
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Education level
   - Income bracket
   - Occupation
   - Geographic location

2. Economic Attributes
   - Risk tolerance
   - Spending habits
   - Saving preferences
   - Investment experience

3. Personality Traits
   - Openness to experience
   - Conscientiousness
   - Extraversion
   - Agreeableness
   - Neuroticism

4. Hobbies and Interests
   - List of potential hobbies relevant to economic behavior

5. Decision-Making Styles
   - Rational
   - Emotional
   - Impulsive
   - Collaborative

## Generation Process

1. Data Sources
   - Use real-world demographic data to inform distributions
   - Incorporate economic survey data for realistic attribute ranges

2. Distribution Sampling
   - Implement methods to sample from appropriate statistical distributions for each attribute

3. Correlation Handling
   - Ensure realistic correlations between attributes (e.g., education level and income)

4. Persona Template
   - Create a structured template to store generated persona information

5. Diversity Ensuring Mechanisms
   - Implement checks to ensure a diverse range of personas are generated

6. Scaling Considerations
   - Design the system to efficiently generate large numbers of personas (up to millions)

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up a database to store persona information
2. Develop a Python script for persona generation
   - Use libraries like NumPy for statistical distributions
   - Implement correlation logic between attributes
3. Create a command-line interface for generating personas
4. Implement export functionality (e.g., JSON, CSV) for use in simulation

## Validation and Testing

1. Statistical analysis of generated personas
2. Peer review by economists and sociologists
3. Small-scale simulations to test persona behavior

## Future Enhancements

1. Machine learning integration for more complex persona generation
2. Real-time persona adaptation based on simulation outcomes
3. Integration with external data sources for up-to-date demographic information

## Ethical Considerations

1. Ensure privacy and anonymity in persona generation
2. Avoid reinforcing stereotypes or biases in persona attributes
3. Regular audits of persona diversity and representation

By following this guide, we can create a robust system for generating diverse, realistic personas for our multi-agent market simulation, enabling more accurate and insightful studies of bounded rational behavior in economic scenarios.
