# Orchestrator TODO

1. Update `orchestrator.py`:
   - Ensure the `run_simulation` method is using the correct calls to run the auction and update agents:
     ```python
     def run_simulation(self):
         logger.info("Starting simulation")
         
         auction_env = self.environments['auction']
         while auction_env.current_step < auction_env.max_steps:
             auction_env.step()  # This will internally call auction.run_auction()
             logger.info(f"Completed auction step {auction_env.current_step}")
             
             # Update other environments if necessary
             # self.environments['info_board'].update(...)
             # self.environments['group_chat'].update(...)
             
             # Agent interactions are saved automatically in the step method
         
         logger.info("Simulation completed")

2. Update `auction_environment.py`:
   - Ensure the `AuctionEnvironment` class has a `step` method that calls the auction's `run_auction` method:
     ```python
     def step(self):
         self.auction.run_auction()
         self.current_step += 1
         for agent in self.agents:
             agent.save_interactions(self.current_step)
         return self.get_global_state()
     ```

3. Update `auction.py`:
   - Ensure the `DoubleAuction` class has a `run_auction` method that handles a single round of the auction:
     ```python
     def run_auction(self):
         # Collect bids and asks
         # Match orders
         # Execute trades
         # Update order book
         self.current_round += 1
     ```

4. Update `market_agent_todo.py`:
   - No changes needed for `save_interactions`, but ensure the `MarketAgent` class is properly interacting with the auction environment:
     ```python
     def generate_action(self, environment_name: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
         # Generate bid or ask based on current market state
         # This method should be called by the environment during the auction step
     ```

5. Integration:
   - Ensure all components (Orchestrator, MarketAgent, AuctionEnvironment, DoubleAuction) work together seamlessly
   - Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the system

6. Testing:
   - Create unit tests for each component
   - Implement integration tests to ensure the entire system works as expected

7. Documentation:
   - Add detailed docstrings to all classes and methods
   - Create a README.md file explaining how to set up and run the simulation
